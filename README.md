# <a href="https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a> Hey! I'm Thanasis Traitsis 
I'm **Flutter** enthusiast and Frontend software developer from Greece 🇬🇷, with passion for **mobile development**. Through both professional work and freelance projects, I've honed my skills in crafting applications. After navigating through numerous coding nightmares, I discovered the beauty of the coding community and the invaluable support it offers. Inspired by all of this, I started a blogging journey to share my insights and help fellow developers navigate their coding adventures.

🎓 Graduated from Department of Information Technology and Electronic Systems Engineering, of the International University of Greece (IHU).

👨‍💻 I'm currently honing my skills in Flutter Development by working on various projects that challenge me to push my limits and explore new techniques and technologies.

📝 Join me on this learning adventure, and let's explore the **"Flutterverse"** together. You can read all of my blogs here:

## 📱 My First Mobile Game
<img src="https://github.com/Thanasis-Traitsis/find_the_words/blob/main/photos/wallpaper.png?raw=true" width="400"> <br>
**Βρες τις Λέξεις** is a dynamic and immersive mobile word puzzle game, based on the greek language, that revolutionizes the crossword experience! Unlike traditional word games, every stage in my game is dynamically generated based on your progress, ensuring a unique and challenging experience with each level you conquer.
<br>
While the concept of the game may seem familiar at first glance, the experience for players is truly unique. Every stage presents a new set of challenges, with difficulty increasing as you advance through the game.

<br>
**Technologies and Tools I used:** <br>
- Flutter, Dart, Firebase, AndroidStudio, XCode, VSCode, Figma, JavaScript, bun

You can view the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/Thanasis-Traitsis/find_the_words"><b>Find The Words</b></a>
